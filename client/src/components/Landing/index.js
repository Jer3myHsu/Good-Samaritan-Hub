          Our goal is to assist vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and immunocompromised,
          who do not have someone to help them. On our site, we match
          volunteers with people in need of helpâ€”for example, with groceries or pickups.
          Our site currently only supports locations in the GTA, but we plan to expand
          our reach in the near future."
